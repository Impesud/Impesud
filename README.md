CTO & Senior Technical Instructor with over ten years of experience delivering enterprise IT projects and more than three years in technical training. Since 2015 I have led initiatives spanning ITSM, ITOM, web & e-commerce, CRM/ERP, API integration, cybersecurity, digital transformation and RPA + AI across Waterfall, hybrid and Agile frameworks in Italy, Spain, France, Switzerland and Russia. As a PMI member since 2021, I apply modern project management techniques to high-tech and AI-driven environments.

Since 2022 I design and deliver courses on Microsoft 365, ServiceNow, Oracle, Machine Learning, AI, GPT and CTO & Project Management Fundamentals. I’m currently preparing for CPMAI v7 (Certified Project Management & AI Practitioner). My key certifications and badgets include AI (PMI & Google), Machine Learning (freeCodeCamp & Google) and AI & Data Analysis (Microsoft).

My AI & technical skill set spans data science & machine learning (preprocessing, feature engineering, supervised & unsupervised models), NLP & generative AI (chatbots, recommendation engines, content generation) and platforms such as Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), Azure AI, AWS SageMaker and the OpenAI API.

I’m fluent in Italian (C2) and Spanish (C2), proficient in English (B2) and Russian (B1), and maintain my French (B1) and German (B1) through ongoing study.

I believe that “theory without practice is empty, and practice without theory is blind.” If you’re looking for someone who can design, teach and implement AI-driven solutions, let’s connect!
